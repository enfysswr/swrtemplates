## Generic DR

I’m sorry that your journey was delayed. If you were delayed for at least 15 minutes, you may be entitled to compensation through our Delay Repay scheme. Please use the compensation claim form at:

https://delayrepay.southwesternrailway.com/

Alternatively, you can get a paper application form from any station, which can be returned to a staff member, or posted free of charge. Any claim must be made within 28 days of the date travelled.

## Junk Filter

Thank you for contacting us. I’m sorry for the delay in response to your last correspondence. Unfortunately, we have been experiencing some problems with our junk mail filter and customer emails have been redirected there without us knowing. The issue has been investigated and corrected.

## Introduction of @Station 1

I’m sorry to hear that you’re unhappy with the new Ticket Office equipment.

The new equipment for selling tickets is a major upgrade on the previous system, which after 13 years of use was becoming obsolete. We have already installed the new equipment in around 10% of our Ticket Offices. Due to the system being so new, our Ticket Office staff are still learning on the job but there is a comprehensive training and support programme behind our Ticket Office staff to ensure that the time to process transactions continues to improve and with time, become faster than they were with their previous equipment.

The new equipment in Ticket Offices opens Ticket Offices to in the future, for example being able to issue Smartcard products and the software that powers the new equipment is always being updated to make the experience for staff and customers better.

Once again, I’m sorry about any inconvenience that you may have encountered.

## Introduction of @station 2

We are introducing a new ticket issuing system in our ticket offices across the SWR network. The new system is replacing one that was introduced in 2007, it is a modern tablet based device that will enable us to offer smart ticketing through our ticket offices. We are currently trialling the system at a number of pilot locations, initially this was in parallel to the existing system and a Stations with multiple windows available.
 
Unfortunately it is inevitably that with any new system there will be teething issues with the system and as our staff get used to it despite the testing and training that has been completed previously. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by the issues at Farnham.

## Unaware of DR

I’m sorry that you didn’t know about the changes in how to claim your compensation. Our Delay Repay scheme was launched on 04 September 2017 for any delay of at least 30 minutes, and 15 minutes since December. We didn’t target any group specifically regarding communications for the launch as the scheme involves all types of ticket holders. However, we did publicise the new scheme before it started through:
·         Social media;
·         On-board announcements;
·         Website;
·         Station posters; and
·         Leaflets / claim forms.
  
We understand that some of our customers aren’t happy with this new system, which was required by the Department for Transport to bring us in line with other Train Operating Companies, who were already using it. However, please note that you’ll now receive compensation for delays of at least 15 minutes, regardless of the cause. Previously compensation was only paid for delays of at least one hour, and was subject to several conditions.

The system was introduced to make claims quicker and easier for our customers, but we appreciate that there have been issues, some of which are related to the system itself and some because customers aren’t yet familiar with it. It’s reliant on you including the correct information for the journey you intended to make, and the necessary supporting documentation.
The positive news is that we have recently switched to an automatic payment scheme, where customers who travel with one of our Smartcards or an Advance ticket purchased through the South Western sales channels are paid compensation directly back to the method that the purchase was made. 

I’m sorry that you’ve found the process to be difficult, but I hope it will become easier as problems are resolved. Thanks for taking the time to write to us.

## Unhappy with DR vs Void Days

Under the old scheme that was run by our predecessor the Void day scheme 50% or more peak time trains needed to be 40 mins late to be eligible for a void day. This also had to be “within our control” so occasions that were weather related, vandalism or trespasses would anatomically not be considered and regardless of the lengths of delays no compensation would be paid.   

This meant that as we were working on averages, the service that you intended to catch may have been delayed, but if the service as a whole was running on time as a season ticket holder you would not get any compensation, however a daily ticket holder may have been eligible as their compensation was based on the service they were on.
I am sure that you would agree that it was not appropriate to have a system were by a daily ticket holder would have been able to claim for a delay for the same journey that a season ticket holder would not be entitled to anything was not a fair scheme.

We apricate that when you put each claim in it may seem like a minimal amount you are getting back or that as you must put a claim in yourself you may not apply for everything your entitled to. To help are passengers get everything that they are entitled to, we are working on automatic delay repay starting with a system for are Smartcard holders so that our passengers can have the benefit of both schemes. 

## CLJ less calls after May 2019 timetable change at peak

I’m sorry to hear that you aren’t happy with the May 2019 timetable changes regarding the reduced calls to Clapham Junction during Peak times.

I can advise that unfortunately the amount of Peak time calls at Clapham Junction have been reduced to meet the ever growing demand on our network. With each call at Clapham Junction, less paths are available for customers travelling to London Waterloo and therefore we have made these changes to accommodate the demand for additional services to London Waterloo.
I’m sorry that this inconveniences you, but we must unfortunately strike a balance with the allocation of the limited paths for trains between Clapham Junction and London Waterloo to ensure we’re able to operate at maximum capacity for the majority of our customers.

## FRM Plt 1&2 Toilets 

Unfortunately, the toilets at Fareham on Platforms 1 and 2 have unfortunately been subject to drainage issues and this is now in the hands of the station property team who are in the process of arranging a more powerful macerator to be installed so that the toilets can be put back into operation on these platforms.  

I am sorry for the inconvenience caused in the meantime. 

 
 ## Short forms May 2019 - 442's
 
 I’m sorry to hear that you’re unhappy with the short formations and uncomfortable journeys since the May 2019 timetable change has come into effect. In order to continue to meet our franchise obligations we have increased the number of services. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, the introduction of the Class 442 trains to support the timetable changes has been delayed and this has caused a shortage of rolling stock and a shortage and the subsequent short forms.
I’m pleased to advise that the problems are close to being resolved and the introduction of the Class 442 trains will free up stock being used for the additional services and trains will return once again to their intended length.

Once again, I’m sorry for any inconvenience caused in the meantime.



## Strike Explanation and DR offer

We’re very sorry that your journeys have been disrupted due to strike action, which has been hugely disappointing, given the positive talks we’ve had with local union representatives. We’re asking the RMT to work with us to deliver the best possible service to our customers, and we’ve made it clear that we’re guaranteeing jobs, salaries and the terms and conditions of our guards. In fact, as we expand our fleet and services, we’ll be creating more jobs.


The RMT is concerned that the introduction of new modern suburban trains later this year, will reduce the need for guards. However, this is simply not true, although we want to discuss with them how we can keep customers moving if a guard isn’t available. The framework proposal we have offered, which applies only to our new 701 stock, would continue to see a guard rostered on all services. All other trains will continue to require a guard whilst in passenger service at all times.
During the action, we have had to implement amended timetables based on the number of train crew available and despite our best efforts, we weren’t able to provide a train service on your route.


We’re also offering Delay Repay for customers affected by delays against the amended ‘strike timetable’. If you were delayed for 15 minutes or more, you could be entitled to compensation. Please use the form at the link below to make a claim:


https://delayrepay.southwesternrailway.com


Or alternatively you can collect a paper form from any South Western Railway staffed Ticket Office.

##Dangerous Overcrowding 

I appreciate that travelling on an overcrowded service is not ideal and I note your point about safety and overcrowding. All the trains we operate do so in full compliance with all safety requirements and are safe to operate on all the routes they are passed to run on. Every train is designed to operate safely, even when full and standing, with no adverse effect on structural integrity and braking performance. There is no statutory limit on the numbers travelling on a train and to enforce such a limit would be difficult unlike a bus or plane, where access is restricted to a particular door for example. Many stations are unstaffed and trains have many doors all providing access. A study by the HSE concluded that overcrowding on trains was not an issue of safety per se but was an issue of comfort. 


We want our customers to travel in comfort and I very much regret your disappointment.  Crowded trains, are a particularly difficult problem for us on a daily basis and this is exacerbated when there are events held on our network. We are working with the Department for Transport and Network Rail to improve capacity and seek a long-term solution to the problem. I am afraid however that any solutions will need to be considered by the Department for Transport and Network Rail and be considered amongst other rail investment priorities but South Western Railway is doing what it can within the existing franchise to minimise overcrowding as much as possible.


I am sorry that on this occasion we let you down,  and I do hope future journeys prove more enjoyable.
